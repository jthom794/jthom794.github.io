    <main>
        <p><strong>Historical Significance:</strong> The Great Wall was built over several centuries, beginning as early as the 7th century BC, with major construction and expansion occurring during the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC) and the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 AD). Its primary purpose was to serve as a defense against invasions and incursions by various nomadic tribes from the north, particularly the Mongols and the Xiongnu.</p>
        <p><strong>Construction:</strong> The wall is not a single continuous structure but a series of walls, fortifications, and natural barriers. It is constructed from various materials, including stone, brick, tamped earth, and wood. Its construction is a testament to the engineering and architectural skills of the time.</p>
        <p><strong>Length:</strong> The total length of the Great Wall, including all its branches and sections, is estimated to be around 13,171 miles (21,196 kilometers).</p>
        <p><strong>Cultural Significance:</strong> The Great Wall of China is not only a symbol of defense but also a symbol of China's rich history, culture, and heritage. It represents the enduring spirit and determination of the Chinese people.</p>
        <p><strong>Myth and Reality:</strong> Contrary to popular myth, the Great Wall cannot be seen from space without aid. It is not a single continuous wall but a network of walls and fortifications. It was not built in one continuous effort but expanded and rebuilt over centuries.</p>
        <p><strong>Tourism:</strong> Many sections of the Great Wall are open to tourists, with some sections, like Badaling and Mutianyu, being easily accessible from Beijing and well-preserved. Visitors can hike, take cable cars, and explore watchtowers, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape.</p>
        <p><strong>Conservation:</strong> The Great Wall has faced threats from natural elements, erosion, and human activities. Ongoing efforts are made to protect and preserve this cultural treasure.</p>
