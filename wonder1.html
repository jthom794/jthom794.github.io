        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>The Great Wall was built for various reasons over several centuries. Its primary purpose was defense, protecting the Chinese states and empires from invasions by nomadic tribes and military incursions.</p>

        <h2>Construction</h2>
        <p>The wall is not a single continuous structure but rather a series of walls, fortifications, and natural barriers built over time. The most famous sections were constructed during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). These sections are made of stone, brick, tamped earth, and other materials.</p>

        <h2>Length</h2>
        <p>The total length of the Great Wall, including all its branches and sections, is estimated to be around 13,171 miles (21,196 kilometers).</p>

        <h2>Significance</h2>

        <h2>Myth and Reality</h2>
        <p>Contrary to the popular myth, the Great Wall cannot be seen from space without aid. It was not a single continuous wall but a series of barriers and fortifications. It was not built in one continuous effort but expanded and rebuilt over centuries.</p>
