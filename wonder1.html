    <main>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The Great Wall was built for various reasons over several centuries. Its primary purpose was defense, protecting the Chinese states and empires from invasions by nomadic tribes and military incursions.</p>
        <p><strong>Construction:</strong> The wall is not a single continuous structure but rather a series of walls, fortifications, and natural barriers built over time. The most famous sections were constructed during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). These sections are made of stone, brick, tamped earth, and other materials.</p>
        <p><strong>Length:</strong> The total length of the Great Wall, including all its branches and sections, is estimated to be around 13,171 miles (21,196 kilometers).</p>
        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> The Great Wall is one of the most recognizable symbols of China and is considered one of the most impressive architectural feats in history. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site and a popular tourist attraction.</p>
        <p><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Beyond its military function, the wall has significant cultural and historical importance. It has been a source of inspiration in art, literature, and film, representing the spirit and resilience of the Chinese people.</p>
        <p><strong>Myth and Reality:</strong> Contrary to the popular myth, the Great Wall cannot be seen from space without aid. It was not a single continuous wall but a series of barriers and fortifications. It was not built in one continuous effort but expanded and rebuilt over centuries.</p>
        <p><strong>Tourism:</strong> Many sections of the Great Wall are open to tourists. Some sections, like the Badaling and Mutianyu, are easily accessible from Beijing and are well-preserved. Visitors can hike, take cable cars, and explore watchtowers.</p>
        <p><strong>Conservation:</strong> The Great Wall has faced threats from natural elements, erosion, and human activities. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this cultural treasure.</p>
        <p>Overall, the Great Wall of China is a symbol of China's rich history, its engineering prowess, and its enduring cultural significance. It remains a source of national pride and an important historical site.</p>
